## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Optional)

### Not Implemented (Out of Scope)
These features were considered but not implemented to keep the project focused and lightweight:

1. **Portfolio Category Filter**
   - Reason: Would require more complex state management
   - Alternative: Current showcase is clean and simple

2. **Price Calculator**
   - Reason: Requires pricing logic from client
   - Alternative: RFQ form captures all needed info

3. **Multi-step Form Wizard**
   - Reason: Current single-step form with auto-save is simpler
   - Alternative: Form is already user-friendly

4. **Advanced GSAP Animations**
   - Reason: Kept lightweight for performance
   - Alternative: Subtle CSS animations are sufficient

5. **Service Worker / PWA**
   - Reason: Commented out, ready when needed
   - Alternative: Can be enabled in future
